# Tula
Tula is a Python-based project that utilizes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in conjunction with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate multiple variations of a given input image. This project is designed to create diverse and unique images from a single source image through a combination of generative modeling and permutation techniques.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy
